      Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is a client-side code injection attack. The
      attacker aims to execute malicious scripts in a web browser of the victim
      by including malicious code in a legitimate web page or web application.
      The actual attack occurs when the victim visits the web page or web
      application that executes the malicious code. The web page or web
      application becomes a vehicle to deliver the malicious script to the
      userâ€™s browser. Vulnerable vehicles that are commonly used for Cross-site
      Scripting attacks are forums, message boards, and web pages that allow
      comments. <br>
       <br> attacker who exploits a cross-site scripting vulnerability is
      typically able to: Impersonate or masquerade as the victim user. Carry out
      any action that the user is able to perform. Read any data that the user
      is able to access. Capture the user's login credentials. Perform virtual
      defacement of the web site. Inject trojan functionality into the web site.
      Preventing cross-site scripting is trivial in some cases but can be much
      harder depending on the complexity of the application and the ways it
      handles user-controllable data. In general, effectively preventing XSS
      vulnerabilities is likely to involve a combination of the following
      measures: Filter input on arrival. At the point where user input is
      received, filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected or
      valid input. Encode data on output. At the point where user-controllable
      data is output in HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from
      being interpreted as active content. Depending on the output context, this
      might require applying combinations of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS
      encoding. Use appropriate response headers. <br>
      <br>To prevent XSS in HTTP
      responses that aren't intended to contain any HTML or JavaScript, you can
      use the Content-Type and X-Content-Type-Options headers to ensure that
      browsers interpret the responses in the way you intend. Content Security
      Policy. As a last line of defense, you can use Content Security Policy
      (CSP) to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur.
